I need to know how to add animation to my project. I think the steps are making a new project to test out animation with another model. I need to find a video or a blog that gives us a step-by-step on how to do it. Then follow it and pray it works.  

2/8/2024:
made a new project and tested out animations all I have right now is my player walking for a few seconds and then stopping. The [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF6kezDQZ7s) helped me with that I learned how to add animation when the player is pressing the key w but I still need to work on why it just stops randomly and doesn't move anymore.

* I tested it out and it worked when I pressed w it started to walk but then stopped.
