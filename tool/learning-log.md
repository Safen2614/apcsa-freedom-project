made a new project and tests out animations all I have right now is my player walking for a few seconds and then stopping. The [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF6kezDQZ7s) that helped me with that I learned how to add animation when the player is pressing the key w but I still need to work on why it just stops randomly and doesn't move anymore.
