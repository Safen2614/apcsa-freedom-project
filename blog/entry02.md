I have chosen to learn unity. I'm working with Uylesses and Jaiden on a unity game. I'm trying to make a game with a player that moves make location where he can move around. So then I looked up how to added a player model. On unity there was an assest tab so I looked up if theres a place to get free assests from somewhere and there was. I made an account on the unity assest store and downloaded the one that stood out for me. I got the [free Low Poly Human - RPG Character](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/fantasy/free-low-poly-human-rpg-character-219979) it had animations and clothes for my player. I downloaded it and added it to my unity project. I then looked up how to move my player character. This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQLvcS9FxnY) really made it simple for me and gave me code that I can work with. What I need to work on is that my character is floating when I start the game and also it doesnt have any animation. So my goals for winter break is to at least add animation for walking foward.
