## using blender

I wanted to try and build a house for our game. So first I drew what my house should look like.

It's a simple drawing but it's something to start from. So then the next question came "How I'm I gonna make this house?" I looked up a blender [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XyIYRW_2xk) and learned how to use the UI first.

## Learning the UI of blender
When you open up blender you are hit with ![blender start](https://github.com/Safen2614/apcsa-freedom-project/assets/91745058/383bc1a6-8a0f-4163-8e18-43a8b4f1a0ca)

just a cube, a camera, and light. Then I started to question how people made things that looks so realistic from just a small cube. After that, I started to scale up the cube using the buttons on the left   
![blender thing](https://github.com/Safen2614/apcsa-freedom-project/assets/91745058/494f4380-0c1c-4745-8230-3a7b660f3aa8)
now I was pressing random buttons and pressed tab and when I pressed tab it took me to the edit mode of the cube. There were black dots on every corner of the cube. I looked up what it's called and what does it and it's called a vertex, you could also select the edge of a shape or the face (I didn't know that). I then clicked this button that opened up to a transform page. I could specifically put numbers to how I want it. I then wanted to start with the roof. I learned that if you select the face of the shape and press e it would make the shape longer but it adds new vertexes on the bottom or where it left off.

I wanted to learn how I could merge the 2 vertexes at the center.

so I went and tried that and it worked! Now it started looking like a house.
