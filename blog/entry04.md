## using blender

I wanted to try and build a house for our game. So first I drew what my house should look like.

It's a simple drawing but it's something to start from. So then the next question came "How I'm I gonna make this house?" I looked up a blender [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XyIYRW_2xk) and learned how to use the UI first.

## Learning the UI of blender
When you open up blender you are hit with ![blender start](https://github.com/Safen2614/apcsa-freedom-project/assets/91745058/383bc1a6-8a0f-4163-8e18-43a8b4f1a0ca)

just a cube, a camera, and light. Then I started to question how people made things that looks so realistic from just a small cube. After that, I started to scale up the cube using the buttons on the left
